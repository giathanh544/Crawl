# Crawl
My First Time Project About Crawl
1. I use `CURL` to **crawl** data from website
In folder **get_data** is file basic to crawl website with some step basic
    Note :  *set_time_limit(0); //it's time to crawl....you should set = 0
            you should use function proxy, cause if you use your real proxy to crawl maybe be block proxy. The best is use free proxy in internet*
2. In folder **download_data** i download one picture from google 
    Note : *curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 3600); careful the time you set. And one flaw, with this code you just download one picture with 1 line code*
